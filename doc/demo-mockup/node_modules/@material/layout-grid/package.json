  "readme": "# mdc-layout-grid\n\nMDC layout grid is a CSS-only component that implements the\n[Material Design layout grid guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/responsive-ui.html#responsive-ui-grid),\nand makes them available to developers as CSS classes and Sass mixins.\n\nIt uses [CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/) where possible, with a CSS Flexible Box fallback everywhere else.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save @material/layout-grid\n```\n\n## The layout grid\n\nA grid consists of a group of cells, which get positioned in sequence according to a predefined number of columns.\nCells specify how many columns to span (the default being 4), and get placed side by side while there is room. When\nthere isn't enough room for a cell, it gets moved to the beginning of the next row, and placement continues as usual.\n\nThe grid has 12 columns in desktop mode (>= 840px), 8 columns in tablet mode (>= 480px), and 4 columns in phone mode\n(< 480px). Column widths are variable; margins and gutters are fixed, with columns taking up the remainder of the space.\n\nMargins (the space between the edge of the grid and the edge of the first cell) and gutters (the space between edges of\nadjacent cells) are user-definable, with the Material Design spec recommending 8px, 16px, 24px or 40px as the sizes to\nchoose from. The default margin and gutter are both 16px, but they don't have to be the same size.\n\nThe grid and cells are not styled in any way, serving only for alignment and positioning of elements.\n\n\n## CSS class usage\n\n```html\n<div class=\"mdc-layout-grid\">\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe grid should have the `mdc-layout-grid` class, and every cell should have the `mdc-layout-grid__cell` class.\nBehavior for grids containing direct children without the `mdc-layout-grid__cell` class is undefined.\n\n### Margins and gutters\n\nThe default size for both the margins and gutters in MDC layout grid is 16px.\n\nYou can change the margins and gutters for a grid using the `--mdc-layout-grid-margin` and `--mdc-layout-grid-gutter`\ncustom properties, respectively. This requires support for CSS custom properties on the end-user's browser.\n\nThe Material Design spec recommends 8px, 16px, 24px or 40px as the sizes to choose from, but MDC layout grid doesn't\nimpose any restrictions.\n\n```css\n.my-grid {\n  --mdc-layout-grid-margin: 40px;\n  --mdc-layout-grid-gutter: 16px;\n}\n```\n\n> Note: Due to the implementation of MDC layout grid, it's not possible to use a margin smaller than half of the size\nof the gutter, in most browsers. As support for [CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/) lands in browsers, this\nlimitation will go away, as MDC layout grid is progressively enhanced to support it.\n\n### Column spans\n\n```html\n<div class=\"mdc-layout-grid\">\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-6\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-4\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-2\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nCells have a default span size of 4 columns, with other sizes being possible by applying one of the span classes, of the\nform `mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-{columns}`, where `{columns}` is an integer between 1 and 12.\n\nIf the chosen span size is larger than the available number of columns at the current screen size, the cell behaves as\nif its chosen span size were equal to the available number of columns at that screen size. That is, it takes up the\nentirety of its row, and no more than that.\n\n### Column spans for specific screen sizes\n\nIt's possible to tweak the behavior of cells further by defining different column spans for specific screen sizes.\nThese override the default at that size.\n\nYou can do that with the `mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-{columns}-{screen_size}` classes, where `{columns}` is an integer\nbetween 1 and 12 and `{screen_size}` is one of `desktop`, `tablet` or `phone`.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"mdc-layout-grid\">\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-6 mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-8-tablet\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-4 mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-6-tablet\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-2 mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-4-phone\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn the example above, the first cell has a default span of 6, the second 4, and the third 2. However, at tablet sizes,\nthe first cell becomes 8 columns wide instead, and the second 6 columns wide. At phone sizes, the third cell becomes 4\ncolumns wide.\n\n### Reordering\n\nBy default, items are positioned in the source order. However, you can reorder them by using the\n`mdc-layout-grid__cell--order-{number}` classes, where `{order}` is an integer between 1 and 12.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"mdc-layout-grid\">\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--order-3\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--order-1\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--order-2\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nPlease bear in mind that this may have an impact on accessibility, since screen readers and other tools tend to follow\nsource order.\n\n### Alignment\n\nItems are defined to stretch, by default, taking up the height of their corresponding row. You can switch to a different\nbehavior by using one of the `mdc-layout-grid__cell--align-{position}` alignment classes, where `{position}` is one of\n`{top}`, `{middle}` or `{bottom}`.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"mdc-layout-grid\">\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--align-top\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--align-middle\"></div>\n  <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--align-bottom\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n## Sass mixin usage\n\n### mdc-layout-grid\n\n```scss\n@include mdc-layout-grid(16px, 16px, 1600px);\n```\n\n`mdc-layout-grid` defines a grid and should be applied to the container element. The mixin takes three parameters:\n- `$margin`: the size of the grid margin.\n- `$gutter`: the size of the gutter between cells.\n- `$max-width` (optional): the maximum width of the grid, at which point space stops being distributed by the columns.\n\nNote that the margin and gutter can be overriden at runtime by using the CSS custom properties detailed in the\n\"Margins and gutters\" section under \"CSS class usage\".\n\n### mdc-layout-grid-cell\n\n```scss\n@include mdc-layout-grid-cell(16px, 4);\n```\n\n`mdc-layout-grid-cell` defines a cell and should be applied to the cell element. The mixin takes two parameters:\n- `$gutter`: the size of the gutter between cells. Be sure to use the same value as for the parent grid.\n- `$span` (optional, default 4): how many columns this cell should span (1 to 12).\n\n### mdc-layout-grid-cell-order\n\n```scss\n@include mdc-layout-grid-cell(16px);\n@include mdc-layout-grid-cell-order(2);\n```\n\n`mdl-layout-grid-cell-order` reorders a cell inside a grid. It's an optional mixin that should be applied to the cell\nelement, together with the mandatory `mdc-layout-grid-cell`.\n\nIt takes a single parameter, `$order`, which expects a value from 1 to 12.\n\n### mdc-layout-grid-cell-align\n\n```scss\n@include mdc-layout-grid-cell(16px);\n@include mdc-layout-grid-cell-align(top);\n```\n\n`mdl-layout-grid-cell-align` aligns a cell vertically inside a grid. It's an optional mixin that should be applied to\nthe cell element, together with the mandatory `mdc-layout-grid-cell`.\n\nIt takes a single parameter, `$position`, which expects `top`, `middle` or `bottom` as values.\n",
